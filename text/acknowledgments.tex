\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
First of all, I would like to thank my advisor, Professor Yoshimitsu Aoki, for welcoming me into his laboratory. Thank to his guidance and expertise, I was able to complete my studies and grow as a student.

I would also like to thank my lab mates for their constant support and help. They contributed to make these two years in Japan a great experience and helped me grow as a person. In particular, I would like to thank Yu Inoue, Miki Takata, Christian Lanius and Siti Nor Khuzaimah Binti Amit for their help in my research and their friendly act toward me everyday.

I also would like to thank the French community at Keio University for its incredible cohesion and cheerfulness. In particular, I would like to thank my roommates: Pierre-Yves Maillard, Come Duret, Ken Planas and Nicolas Sirletti for sharing my life during these two years.

Thank to the Centrale Marseille International Relation team, and in particular to Mr Christophe Pouet, who allowed me to apply for the double degree program at Keio University and supported me during this experience.

Finally, I am grateful to my friends and family back in France who supported me throughout this journey and always believed in me. Their love and support helped me through the hard times.
